A proof-of-concept Skype chatbot.

REQUIRES: Skype4Py Python module: 'easy_install skype4py'
	  Skype desktop application from http://www.skype.com

Tested on Ubuntu 10.04.

TO RUN:
Since Skype4Py requires a running instance of the dektop client, you'll need to
be running an X session of some sort.

1) Start up Skype & login to an account. This will be the bot's voice.
2) Open a console window and run 'python skypebot.py'

Volia!
